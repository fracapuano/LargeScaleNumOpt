# Large Scale Numerical Optimization  

For the course in Numerical Optimization for Large Scale Problems I produced three different homeworks: 

1) An *unconstrained optimization* project, in which I tackled the resolution of large scale problems using algorithms presented during the course and presented in the "Numerical Optmization" by Nocedal and Wright textbook. To obtain better results in term of convergence, I even developed my own variant of one of these methods, based on an ensemble of two different optimization algorithms. 
3) A *constrained optimization* project, in which I tackled the problem of optimizing a large scale problem in box contraints
4) A *stochastic optimization* project, in which I used a Neural Network I personally implemented to approximate a stochastically defined function so that I could find optimal point for the overall stochastic process overall. 

This repository contains the code produced for the *Unconstrained Optimization* homework, which I am more proud of. Alongside with the code there is the text of the paper I produced, in which a full detailed explanation of the problems and my strategies to solve them is presented.
